Sexual Harassment Management Application

Project Overview

The Sexual Harassment Management Application is a secure digital platform designed to facilitate the reporting, management, and resolution of sexual harassment cases within institutions and organizations. The application provides a confidential, efficient, and user-friendly mechanism for victims and witnesses to report incidents while enabling authorized administrators to manage cases professionally and ethically.

Sexual harassment remains underreported due to fear, stigma, lack of trust in reporting channels, and absence of anonymity. This system addresses these challenges by leveraging modern information technology to promote accountability, transparency, and victim protection.

Problem Statement

Traditional methods of reporting sexual harassment such as physical reporting, paper-based systems, or informal channels are often inefficient, insecure, and intimidating to victims. These approaches may lead to delayed responses, loss of evidence, breach of confidentiality, and reduced trust in institutional systems.

There is a need for a centralized, secure, and accessible digital solution that allows victims to report incidents safely and enables institutions to handle cases systematically and responsibly.
